# How to contribute to Project Pandora

### Consider using our Discord server to contact us first

We are generally more responsive on Discord and it can be used to easier coordinate or to direct you to the right place for help.
It is especially advisable to align with us before you make a (larger) contribution in the form of code or assets.
Please do not expect that every pull request will be merged if there was no previously accepted issue on it or an alignment on Discord!

## Did you find a bug?

- **If the bug is about a specific asset/item** or a combination of items, please report it on the [asset repository](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora-assets)'s issue tracker instead of the main repository's issue list.

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora/issues/new).
  Be sure to include:
  - A **title and clear description**
  - **Steps to reproduce the problem**
  - The expected behavior that is not occurring
  - As much other relevant information as possible

- **If you need help, consider getting in touch with us using Discord**.

## Do you want to suggest a new feature or an improvement to an existing feature?

- **If the suggestion is about an existing asset/item**, please report it on the [asset repository](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora-assets)'s issue tracker instead of the main repository's issue list.

- **If the suggestion is about a new asset/item**, please make the suggestion on our Discord. This type of suggestion won't be accepted otherwise.

- **Consider getting in touch with us using Discord**, where we can easily direct you to the right place or give quick feedback on your suggestion without adding noise to the issue tracker.
  Not all decisions have a history on GitHub and the development team usually has a better picture about what has been attempted or rejected in the past.

- **Ensure the suggestion was not already made** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora/issues?q=is%3Aissue), __**including already closed ones**__.

- If you're unable to find an open issue regarding your suggestion, [open a new one](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora/issues/new).
  Be sure to include:
  - A **title and clear description**
  - Clearly describe how your suggestion would work from the **player's perspective**
  - Describe the current situation, existing options and how your suggestion fits into them

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR title is in the following format: `[FIX] Fix registration not allowing funny names`.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem or at least the solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable in the form `Fixes #123`.

## Do you intend to contribute a new asset/item or change an existing one?

- Please take a look at the [asset repository](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora-assets) instead of this one.
  This repository is intended purely for the game's code.

- **Please consider getting in touch with us first using Discord**.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- If there is an existing reviewed and accepted issue about the feature you are intending to implement, write a comment on the issue or __risk someone else starting work on it after you, too, and beating you to it__.

- **If the feature doesn't have an open issue** get in contact with us using Discord or open an issue first and ask for an acceptance review.

- Be aware that we have a firm vision of how we want Pandora to work and things going against that vision will not be accepted. While we will try to work together with you to get your contribution into the game, not all contributions will get in.

- Be aware that all your contributions will be licensed to Project Pandora under the Pandora's [Contributor License Agreement](./contributor-licence-agreement.md).

- **Consider getting in touch with us using Discord**, especially if you are intending to write a bigger feature or you are unsure about something. We are happy to help anyone who wants to help us!

## Do you have questions about a mechanic or the source code?

- Feel free to ask any question on our Discord where there are many active developers or even players who are likely to answer your questions. Do **not** open an issue for questions!

- Also see the [Documentation repository](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/Documentation). It is not complete by far, but it does have reasons for many core decisions that were made or considered.
  It also contains guides regarding asset creation.
