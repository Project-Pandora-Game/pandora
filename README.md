## Getting Started
### Prerequisite

1. Get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Enable `pnpm` with (requires nodejs >= 18.x:
	```console
	corepack enable
	```
3. Install dependencies with `pnpm`:
	```console
	pnpm i
	```
### Client Web
If you don't want to launch [Server](#server-directory) & [Shard](#server-shard) along side client, you can connect directly to the beta server by replacing:

```
DIRECTORY_ADDRESS="http://127.0.0.1:25560"
```
With:
```
DIRECTORY_ADDRESS="https://project-pandora.com"
```
In [.env](./pandora-client-web/.env) file.

Before launching dev server:
```console
cd ./pandora-client-web/
pnpm dev
```
## Local Dev Server
If you want to run everything locally, follow these steps:

1. Get [pandora-assets](https://github.com/Project-Pandora-Game/pandora-assets) repo, follow the instruction with `git clone --recursive` to the same parent directory.
2.  Your folder structure would look like this:
    ```
 | parent (can be any name) |
 | ------------------------ |pandora
	| -- | pandora-assets
	```
3. Build the assets `pnpm i && pnpm build` in `pandora-assets` repo. You should have now have an `out` folder.
	```
 | parent (can be any name) |
 | ------------------------ |pandora
	| -- | pandora-assets/out
	```
4. Go back to `pandora` repository and launch dev services:
	```
	pnpm dev
	```
Congratulations, you've ran the entire pandora stack locally.
