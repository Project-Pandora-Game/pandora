				<h3>Introduction to Pandora with some quick hints to get you started</h3>
			</p>

			<p>
				Pandora's vision is to establish a strict & secure, consensual roleplay platform that focuses on text-heavy interactions.
			</p>

			To that end the following will list some of the existing core features of Pandora.
			Some of these features are explained in greater detail further below.
			<ul>
				<li>Dynamically scaling body model with many poses and free arm movement</li>
				<li>Front and back character view</li>
				<li>A feature-rich room chat (e.g. message editing, advanced text styling)</li>
				<li>Free character placement and movement inside rooms</li>
				<li>Room-level furniture and devices that can be placed freely and that persist with the lifetime of the room</li>
				<li>An already very stable code base (goal: no void memes here)</li>
				<li>Reliable gag talk & locks - development aims to make it impossible to cheat</li>
				<li>A direct messaging system that supports offline messages and a persistent message history</li>
				<li>Ability to use the browser's back/forward buttons to navigate in Pandora</li>
				<li>No safeword feature, but a safemode that makes it harder to be misused to constantly free characters</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Some further details on these features and how to use them:
			</p>

			<h4>Dynamically generated body model with many poses and free arm movement</h4>
			<p>
				In the pose tab, you will find the ability to freely move arms and legs under the "manual pose" section at the bottom of the screen.
				Expand this section to view the respective sliders.
			</p>

			<h4>Front and back character view</h4>
			<p>
				Your character's view can be toggled in the pose menu. The chosen position is seen by everyone in the room.
			</p>

			<h4>A feature-rich room chat</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Click a name in the chat to start whispering to that person</li>
				<li>Right-clicking your own message enables you to edit or delete it for 10 mins after posting it</li>
				<li>To get help on chat commands, start the command by typing the "/" character, which will then show the list of available commands</li>
				<li>You can write Out-Of-Character (OOC) messages by prefixing them with "(("</li>
				<li>You can enclose text with underscores to style it, such as _<i>italic</i>_ and __<b>bold</b>__</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Free character placement and movement inside rooms</h4>
			<p>
				You can freely move your character inside a room by dragging them by the character name below.
				Room admins can also move other characters this way.
			</p>

			<h4>Room-level furniture and devices that can be placed freely and that persist with the lifetime of the room</h4>
			<p>
				Room devices must first be deployed from the room inventory to the room in the item menu.
				Then, you can freely move/position the item in the room by dragging it by the icon below it.
				The icons below room devices can be toggled to be hidden under the "Controls"-tab.
			</p>

			<h4>Stable code base</h4>
			<p>
				Pandora aims for a stable experience without random disconnects. But even if a short disconnect happens, the character will not be shown as disconnected for some time, and you will still receive all the missed chat messages on reconnect, not losing anything.
			</p>

			<h4>Reliable gag talk & locks</h4>
			<p>
				Pandora validates and performs all character interactions on the server,
				preventing the creation of scripts/mods that do undesired actions, such as anti-garble or unauthorized removal of (locked) restraints.<br />
				This ensures consistency in what others see,
				resulting in everyone having the same experience.
			</p>

			<h4>No safeword feature, but a safemode that makes it harder to be misused</h4>
			<p>
				You can access the safemode feature by clicking on your character name in the top left of the screen and then entering safemode in the menu.
			</p>
