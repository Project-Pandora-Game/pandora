			<h2>Spaces</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>
				A space in Pandora always exists in the state it was set up, even when it was empty for a long time.
				You can decorate every room inside a space with room items/furniture and it can theoretically be joined by up
				to { LIMIT_SPACE_MAX_CHARACTER_NUMBER } characters at the same time. A space can contain up to { LIMIT_SPACE_ROOM_COUNT } rooms.<br />
				The "Chat"-tab next to the room view can also be switched to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the "Room"-tab that gives you interaction and configuration possibilities, lets you move between rooms, and shows the location of all characters inside the space</li>
				<li>the "Pose"-tab that lets you change your character's pose</li>
				<li>the "Expressions"-tab that lets you change your character's facial expressions and body states</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Room_layout'>Room layout</h4>
			<p>
				The room view in Pandora consists of the room canvas and the four tabs that show the chat per default.<br />
				In a landscape view the tab is on the right side and it is on the bottom in a portrait view.
				In the Pandora settings (cog-button on the top bar) under the "Interface"-tab and inside the "Room UI" box,
				you can customize the ratio between the space that the room and the tabs area use for both landscape or portrait views.<br />
				While not in your personal space, the top of the room canvas shows the current room's name. Clicking on it expands
				the overlay to show the room's description, if there is one.
				When you enter a room with a new description for the first time after entering a space, the overlay will
				automatically expand to conveniently show it. This will reset under certain conditions, e.g. closing the browser tab.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can zoom the room canvas with the mouse wheel or a pinch-to-zoom gesture.</li>
				<li>A double-click/double-tap on any empty space will zoom-to-fit or reset the camera to fit the room to the screen</li>
				<li>You can drag the canvas freely to see a different part of it while zoomed in.</li>
				<li>If you experience performance issues, you can lower/disable graphics related features in Pandora's settings.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Multiple_rooms'>Multiple rooms per space</h4>
			<p>
				The up to { LIMIT_SPACE_ROOM_COUNT } rooms per space are freely placed on a rectangular grid by the space's admins to create a layout/map of the space.
				This grid is also used to move between rooms and can be found under the "Room"-tab, though it only shows neighboring rooms when there is an accessible path.
				A character can only move to a room that is a direct neighbor of the current room in the four cardinal directions.
				So, for instance, if there is a gap on the grid between the current room and the room to the west, you
				cannot move to that room, unless there is another path through a chain of rooms. Admins of a space can freely move their character
				or other characters, though. They can also interact with all room inventories from everywhere.<br />
				Note that rooms are not a privacy barrier and the chat is space-wide, so every message can be seen from every room of the same space.
				You can filter out chat messages from other rooms for yourself, though, by enabling focus mode by pressing the bar with the white cog above the chat input field.
				That said, if you want privacy or hide something or someone, you should use a space that is private.<br />
				Interactions with rooms or characters in those rooms are only possible if you are in that room or in a directly neighboring room.
				But you can still see the location of every character from everywhere, can open their profile, or preview how they
				look based on their wardrobe. Different rooms currently do not hide information and are just there to enhance roleplaying possibilities.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A space can store a maximum amount of { LIMIT_ITEM_SPACE_ITEMS_TOTAL } items in total across all rooms.</li>
				<li>The ordered list of rooms next to the room grid in the space configuration's "Room management"-tab is there to define the order of the listed rooms under the "Room"-tab.</li>
				<li>In that ordered room list in the "Room management"-tab, the room at the top is the room characters joining the space appear in - reordering the list changes this.</li>
				<li>Room designs can also be exported and imported as a template when creating a new room.</li>
				<li>
					Users can move between neighboring rooms with an active path in three ways: By using the path squares on the ground, by clicking on the room in the map under the
					"Room" tab, or by using the '/moveto' command.
				</li>
				<li>Using a path can turn your character around if the path was configured in such a way by the room designer.</li>
				<li>
					A path is not shown if there is no neighboring room in the cardinal direction this path leads to, if the path is disabled (e.g. representing a wall between two rooms), or
					if the path is usage restricted based on roles, such as "Admin" or "Allowed user", defined in the space configuration's rights management tab.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_ownership'>Space ownership</h4>
			<p>
				Spaces in Pandora are owned by one or more persons.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Every owner is automatically admin in the space and cannot be demoted by other admins.</li>
				<li>Player accounts that are not owner can be made an admin of a space by its owners or other admins.</li>
				<li>Creating a new space makes you automatically owner of it.</li>
				<li>You can add other owners to your space in the "Rights management" configuration tab.</li>
				<li>There is a limit to how many spaces you can own. You can see your ownership limit in the space search behind the heading "My spaces".</li>
				<li>
					If you want to create another space beyond your space ownership limit, you must select any of your owned spaces and either repurpose it or
					give up ownership of that space (resulting in the space being deleted if it has no other owners).
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_deletion'>Space deletion</h4>
			<p>
				To permanently delete a space, you have to give up ownership over it. The space is automatically deleted if it has no other owners.
				Removal of ownership can be done in the space search screen, when clicking on the space, or in the administration screen when inside the space.<br />
				Note that no one can demote other owners - only the owner can to give up their ownership of a space.
			</p>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_persistence'>Space persistence</h4>
			<p>
				Spaces in Pandora are not lost when they are empty. Every room inside the space will stay as it was when it was left, including characters that are offline inside.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All space settings such as name, description, admin and ban lists will be persistent.</li>
				<li>All items in the rooms of the space will stay as and where they are.</li>
				<li>If characters will disconnect or log off inside a space, they will stay inside the current room, until they are removed from it manually or automatically (e.g. through a space's offline character management configuration).</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_visibility'>Space visibility</h4>
			<p>
				Spaces in Pandora can be public or private, which affects who can see them.
				There are two different public space visibility settings: "Public while an admin is inside" and simply "Public".
				Note, that the "Public" setting means that it is only publicly listed while anyone is online inside the space. Offline characters inside do not count.
				If the public condition is no longer fulfilled, the space is temporarily no longer publicly listed in the list of spaces.
				Even then, owners and admins of that space as well as users whose account is on the "Allowed users" list of the space can still see these unlisted public spaces in their list of spaces and join them.
				Despite that, everyone inside a public space can still directly invite other users from their contacts list to the unlisted public space (see <Link to='#SP_Space_invites'>"Space invites"</Link> section).
			</p>
			<p>
				While empty spaces with the visibility "Public" are not visible in the space list (except to their Admins and Allowed users),
				they can still be found using the "Public space search" option in the space list.<br />
				Note, that spaces using "Public while an admin is inside" visibility cannot be found this way.
				This makes the "Public while an admin is inside" setting useful for making sure your space does not diverge from its intended purpose
				and cannot be used by the general public while there is no owner/admin inside, aside from the characters already inside.
			</p>
			<p>
				Spaces can also be locked, which behaves similar to a private space, but prevents anyone except owners and admins from entering the space (leaving the space isn't limited). This also asks owners and admins for confirmation before entering.
				"Allowed users" can still see locked spaces, but not who is inside them and cannot enter them.
				"Join-me" invitations work the same as for private spaces, but "Space-bound" invitations are blocked.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The default when creating a new space is private.</li>
				<li>Private spaces only show in the list of spaces for owners and admins of that space as well as users whose account is on the "Allowed users" list of the space.</li>
				<li>Accounts can still see spaces they are banned from</li>
				<li>
					Certain information about a space can be seen in the space preview popup by anyone able to enter the space even without actually entering it.
					This includes, for example, the list of characters currently inside the space.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_access'>Space access</h4>
			<p>
				Spaces in Pandora that are publicly listed can be joined unless a user is banned from it or the space is full.
				A private space can only be seen and joined by owners, admins and people on the allow list of said space. To invite other users to a private space,
				they have to either be added to one of these lists or be invited by an admin in order to join.
				The admin and "Allowed users" lists can be found in the "Rights management"-tab of the space configuration view. Note that these lists
				work with user account IDs and not with character IDs.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To invite other users to a space, you can send them a direct message with a "join-me" type invite via the "/invite" command.</li>
				<li>
					As a space admin you can also create more powerful and configurable "space-bound" type invite links in the "Rights management"-tab of the
					space configuration view that you can share with others. More details about invite links in the <Link to='#SP_Space_invites'>"Space invites"</Link> section.
				</li>
				<li>When a user's account is banned from a space, the user cannot join it.</li>
				<li>Owners of a space can even join a space when it is already full. When they join they fill one of five temporary overshoot slots above the set maximum.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Let's summarize how to best manage access to private spaces:<br />
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you want a user and all their characters to have permanent access to your space, add them to the list of Allowed users.</li>
				<li>If you want to create a link that your friends can share with their friends, create a "space-bound" invite not tied to any account or character.</li>
				<li>If you want to quickly invite another character for a single time, use the "/invite" command in a direct message to them.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_invites'>Space invites</h4>
			<p>
				Pandora also has two different types of space invites: "space-bound" and "join-me" invite links.<br />
				"Space-bound" invite links can only be created by space owners and admins in the "Rights management"-tab of the
				space configuration view. They are highly configurable.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>These invites can have an infinite or set number of uses, can be permanent or expire after some time.</li>
				<li>"Space-bound" invites can be account-specific, character specific, or can be used by anyone.</li>
				<li>They can be used to join private spaces, empty and unlisted spaces, but not full spaces. Banned accounts also can't use them.</li>
				<li>Space owners and admins can delete these invites at any point in time, after which they can no longer be used.</li>
				<li>You can only create a maximum of { LIMIT_SPACE_BOUND_INVITES } "space-bound" invites per space.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The second type - "join-me" invites - can be created by anyone inside a space by using an "/invite" command in a direct message (DM) chat.
				They are essentially a quick way to tell someone where you are and invite them to join you.<br />
				Note: While a "join-me" invite allows to join an unlisted public room, it does not allow to join a private room, unless the recipient
				is able to join the space even without the invite (e.g. being an admin or on the space's allow list) or the creator of the "join-me" invite is an admin.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can send a "join-me" invite by using the "/invite" command in the direct message input field.</li>
				<li>These invites can be used only once and expire { FormatTimeInterval(LIMIT_JOIN_ME_INVITE_MAX_VALIDITY) } after they were created and sent.</li>
				<li>"Join-me" invites are bound to the user account they are sent to and cannot be used by someone else.</li>
				<li>The invite link only works while the character that created it is still online and inside the space the invite is for.</li>
				<li>The invite details cannot be edited by the one creating it. The purpose of "join-me" invites is to be simple and quick to use.</li>
				<li>Banned accounts cannot be invited this way.</li>
				<li>Space owners, admins and the invite's author can delete these invites at any point in time, after which they can no longer be used.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_features'>Space features</h4>
			<p>
				While creating a room, you can set several space feature check boxes at the bottom of the space creation screen. These cannot be changed after the space creation.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Allow changes to character bodies: Determines if any character inside the space can change their body, for example changing the shape/size of their body,
					or swapping to different eyes, nose, genitals.
				</li>
				<li>
					Development mode: On a development server, spaces can be created in development mode. This enables use of many development tools, such as
					room background calibration tool. Those can however break things when used incorrectly. Because of
					that <strong>this option is not available on the public server for non-developers</strong>.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Space_administration'>Space administration</h4>
			<p>
				To administrate the current room and the space it is part of, you can find a button "space configuration" in the Room-tab.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The default number of characters that can join a space is 10, but the possible upper limit is 100.</li>
				<li>You can set the space's visibility. The default is that the space is private.</li>
				<li>You can set the space's name and a long space description that both are visible from the outside to accounts that can see the space.</li>
				<li>Under the "Rights management"-tab, you can give up space ownership, which deletes the space permanently, if you are the only owner.</li>
				<li>The Admins, Banned, and "Allowed users" lists require the player account id, as they are account-wide.<br />
					The player account id number can be looked up in the account profile of the player.<br />
					<strong>Careful:</strong> Do not mix it up with the character id which starts with "c" followed by a number.<br />
					Alternatively, you can look up the player account id of a character inside the space in the "Room"-Tab. It is the last number behind the name.<br />
					The easiest way to do admin actions is to simply click on the name below a character and select "Admin" in the context menu.
				</li>
				<li>You can also add more rooms to the space, give each a name and a room background/design, or move them to a different coordinate on the space grid.</li>
				<li>
					When creating a space for the first time, you can select if characters can change their <Link to='/wiki/items#IT_Body_parts'>body parts</Link> when inside this space.
					This currently cannot be changed later on.
				</li>
				<li>Admins have mostly the same powers as owners — they can add other admins or take admin rights away from other admins. But admins cannot add owners.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Leaving_a_space'>Leaving a space</h4>
			<p>
				You leave a chat space with the top-right-most button on the black header bar. Restraints or other effects may prevent you from being able to do that.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Closing the browser, disconnecting, changing your character, or logging off, will all leave your character in the current chat space (and room) by default.</li>
				<li>Being inside a <Link to='/wiki/items#IT_Room-level_items'>room device</Link> slot will make you unable to leave a space.</li>
				<li>Most regular restraints will not be able to prevent you from leaving a space.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Personal_space'>Personal space</h4>
			<p>
				Every character has their own personal space that does not count towards your space ownership limit and that cannot be entered by any
				other character. It functions as a singleplayer lobby and cannot be deleted or given up.<br />
				You will automatically end up in the personal space when your selected character is not in any other space. Restraining
				effects (also from <Link to='/wiki/items#IT_Room-level_items'>room devices</Link>)
				will not prevent you from leaving the personal space.<br />
				There are a few actions that you cannot do in other spaces, only in your personal one:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Seeing a list of other spaces.</li>
				<li>Setting a character preview as an icon for the character selection screen.</li>
				<li>Starting one of Pandora's tutorials.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id='SP_Room_inventory'>Room inventory</h4>
			<p>
				Every room has its own room inventory that shows all items that are inside the current room and can be picked up or used by other characters, if permitted
				by the space configuration, or the <Link to='/wiki/characters#CH_Character_permissions'>character permissions</Link> of the targeted character.<br />
				From this screen, you can also create new items inside the room inventory, edit them, or delete them. Items stay in the inventory indefinitely
				as long as they are not moved somewhere else, are deleted, or the room and/or space are deleted, e.g. by giving
				up <Link to='#SP_Space_ownership'>ownership</Link> of a space.<br />
				Clicking on an item in the list opens its edit-view on the right
				side. <Link to='/wiki/items#IT_Room-level_items'>Room devices</Link> can be deployed to the room background by admins of that space.
				You can also move items from one room to another, inside the same space.<br />
				Note that admins can interact with any room inventory from anywhere in the same space, but other users can only interact with the inventory of
				the room their character is inside, as well as with the room inventories of directly neighboring rooms in the four cardinal directions.
			</p>
			<p>
				A room can contain up to { LIMIT_ITEM_ROOM_INVENTORY } items in its room inventory, but only up
				to { LIMIT_ITEM_SPACE_ITEMS_TOTAL } items in total across all rooms of a single space.
			</p>
