								Actions differ from emotes in that they are not written by users,

							<p>
								Remember, the [OOC] tag in front of a message signals everyone that this text was not spoken by your character but comes from the human user behind the screen.<br />
								It can be, for example, used to convey limits, talk about not being comfortable with how the scene is going, or to indicate that you have to leave the club soon.<br />
								It is especially used to ask to be let go or to stop the play, representing a kind of "safeword" usage.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is generally frowned upon using this to talk as your character in this way (IC‑in‑OOC), especially if done to circumvent some in‑character restrictions, such as the character being gagged.
								It also makes it confusing for others to differentiate if the message is meant to be understood as from the character or the user behind it.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Please respect the responsible use of OOC and take the content seriously. It is no longer fun and games if someone asks to be freed in an OOC message!</strong>
