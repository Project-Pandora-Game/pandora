## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (currently version 18)
* Enable `pnpm`:
  ```
  corepack enable
  ```
  Note that if you have an existing Node.js installation, this will only work for Node.js >= 16.10.

To run the app in development mode:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
